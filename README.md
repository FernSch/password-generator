# password-generator

based off of (this by durzal1)[https://github.com/durzal1/password-generator-/blob/master/number.py]
but i made mine in the console. I also decided to add the feature of requiring a number, as most websites require a number in the password.

# how to use
run ``` make_pass(LENGTH_OF_PASS_HERE) ```
note that password must be between 7 and 21 characters
